<strong>Notes:</strong> <br>
All applications must be closed before installing or upgrading the driver.<br>
This procedure requires administrator privileges (admin account or "Run as Administrator").<br>
As the information contained in this document applies to multiple print devices, the word "device" is used as a generic reference to whichever device is being used.<br>
<br>
During installation, a dialog window will appear that will prompt for the generic name (PCL6 V4 Driver for Universal Print) or a version-specific name (RICOH PCL6 V4 UniversalDriver VX.X) of the driver. The version-specific name of the driver cannot be upgraded to a new version of the driver because the naming between the driver with the new version-specific name and the old one is different. Therefore, if there are plans to upgrade the driver to a later version in the future, please select the driver with the generic name.<br>

<h1><a name="Limitations_en">Other important points</a></h1>

<p><h2><a name="">[General Issue]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In the case of specific application, only one part will be printed even if the combination of post-processing features and number of copies by from the driver set of multiple. Post-processing capability refers to the following items.<br>
<ul>
<li>Staple
<li>Punch
<li>Fold
<li>Sort
<li>Perfect Binding
<li>Layout and Booklet etc.<br>
The example of specific application : Microsoft Office<br>
</ul>
<li>In the environment to which the computer name is set by 16 bytes or more, the host name with banner page print is printed only up to 15 bytes.<br>
<li>On some applications, the backside of a duplex page is incremented by the device counter. These applications add a blank page to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify the number of copies using the driver.
<li>Use of Raster Mode with the Layout settings (= pages per sheet) may be printed roughly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Vector Mode in the PCL driver.<br>
<li>If the registry and configuration files that are generated during driver installation are edited or deleted, the behavior of the driver is not guaranteed.<br>
<li>It might take a significant amount time to open "More settings" in the Print Dialog in an application from the Windows Store.<br>
<li>When enabling Poster, blank paper might be printed even if Do not Print Blank Pages is enabled.<br>
<li>When selecting the file path in Windows Store applications, it is necessary to enter the path manually.<br>
<li>The text settings of the Ricoh Driver Utility might behave in the following ways:
<ol>
<li>The text might be empty when entering double-byte characters.
<li>The cursor position will return to the beginning of the input characters when entering text as a password by copying and pasting or copying by holding the SHIFT key.
<li>The text will not change if copying and pasting a number of characters that exceed the maximum character limit.
</ol>
<li>The preview of the watermark will display even if the driver can't print the fonts as a watermark.
<li>Print jobs may be canceled when specific data with including a lot of graphics data is printed.
<li>When two or more printer drivers share the same USB port, USB bidirectional communication may fail.
<li>Only the user who installed the printer driver can use the following functions.
<ul>
<li>Use "Printer Properties".</li>
<li>Edit Shared "One Click Preset Name/Comment" on "Manage One Click Prest List".</li>
<li>Register "One Click Preset" with "Do not Allow User to Register Preset",</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you specify the Web browser of the store application such as Microsoft Edge as the default application, if you try to refer to the help of the printer driver from that browser, the help page is displayed to yourself and you can not refer to the contents.<br>
In that case, change the default Web browser or see the help of the printer driver from the desktop application.</li>
<li>If the printer times out during printing and printing can not be performed, set the network timeout setting of the printer longer (300 seconds, etc.).</li>
<li>When printing using [layout] and [page frame border] function, the underline of the border is printed thin.</li>
<li>When printing using [Choose paper source by PDF page size] setting from the following applications, a different paper size from print setting might be used:<br>
<ul>
<li>Adobe Reader
<li>Adobe Acrobat Reader DC
</ul>
In that case, change [Choose paper source by PDF page size] setting.
</li>
<li>The following issues occurred before the firmware update:<br>
<ul>
<li>When printing in Raster Mode, part of the document might be missing.
<li>When printing with the Watermark function, the output of the watermark might be different from the preview.
<li>When printing with the Front Cover function, only the front cover might be printed and not the rest of the document.
<li>When printing with the Toner Save function, some images might be printed without toner saving.
<li>When printing with both the Watermark and Toner Save functions, some characters might be printed in bold.
<li>Network bidirectional communication might not work correctly for the DL Env. setting and the Custom Paper Size setting.
</ul>
Notes: Target devices and the fixed firmware versions:
<ul>
<li>SP 330DN/SP 3710DN/330DN/3710DN: v1.04 or later
<li>SP 330SN/SP 330SFN/SP 3710SF/330SN/330SFN/3710SF: v1.04 or later
<li>SP C262DNw/SP C261DNw/C262DNw/C261DNw: v1.12 or later

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="">[OS/Windows Related Issues]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The "Web Image Monitor" button in the driver might not work in an IPv6 environment.
<li>When "User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for the Built-in Administrator account" is enabled in "Local Group Policy Editor", client-side rendering might not work when conducting Point and Print. Because of this, the functions that require user information such as "User ID", "User Code", and "Password" will not work.
<li>In Windows 10 or Server 2016, after launching "More settings" in the Print Dialog in an application from the Windows Store, the application might lock up. If this occurs, restart the computer.
<li>If Printing Preferences is launched soon after restarting the computer, the Windows standard UI might be displayed instead of the Ricoh extended UI. If this occurs, wait for a while and then relaunch Printing Preferences.
<li>In Windows 10 or Server 2016, if the "Esc" key is pressed on the Store Device App launched from "More settings" in the Print Dialog in an application from the Windows Store, the setting values are saved and the screen is closed in the same manner as if the "OK" button were pressed.
<li>The "Web Image Monitor" button in the driver might not work on Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2.
</ul>
<h2><a name="">[Driver Setting Related Issues]</a></h2>

<li>Adobe InDesign
</ul>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please specify the number of copies using the application's "Copies" setting.<br>
<li>The use of Reverse Order is not supported with the Duplex, Front Cover, Back Cover, Chapter Pages, Slip Sheet functions.
<li>If the Staple setting is "2 at Center" or if the "Reverse Order" setting is On, the driver will add an extra page to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. The added page will be incremented in the printer's counter. There is no way to prevent this.
<li>A paper mismatch error might occur when the measurement unit in the Custom Paper Size dialog is different from the Custom Size setting on the printer operation panel.
<li>The paper size that is configured on the "Accessories" tab in the extended device properties is not reflected in "Paper available" on the "General" tab and the tray settings on the "Device Settings" tab in "Printer Properties". Please manually select a paper size in "Form to Tray Assignment" on the "Device Settings" tab in "Printer Properties" to configure the "Paper available" setting.
<li>The default measurement unit is dependent on the system settings when the driver is opened.
<li>A Windows login name cannot be displayed in the authentication settings in the Print Dialog in an application from the Windows Store.
<li>Invalid characters entered in text boxes in the Print Dialog in an application from the Windows Store might appear briefly.
<li>In Point and Print environments, the default settings for the following function are not inherited from the printer driver on the server:

<li>"Effects": all 
<li>"Driver Options": all
</ul>
<li>In Point and Print environments, even a user with administrator privileges cannot register a One Click Preset in the Print Dialog in an application from the Windows Store. 
<ul>
<li>"Do not Allow User to Register Preset" is checked in Device Properties. 
</ul>
<li>When more than one printer is connected to the same port and those printers are consolidated into one icon, only the extended device properties of the most recently installed printer is displayed in the context menu of the icon. 
<li>When Increase Auto-keep Settings for Applications is enabled, the driver inherits the printer settings of the first worksheet.
<li>In the General tab in printer properties, the following features donÅft match the actual settings:
<ul>
<li>Color
<li>Double-sided
<li>Staple
</ul>

<li>Word Mobile will display a blank print preview screen and cancel the print job when selecting A0 as the paper size.
<li>There is a difference between the actual paper size and the size displayed in Microsoft Office for the following paper sizes:
<ul>
<li>B3(364 mm x 515 mm) is displayed as "363.9 mm x 514.9 mm" in Microsoft Office.
<li>SRA3(320 mm x 450 mm) is displayed as "319.9 mm x 449.9 mm" in Microsoft Office.
<li>SRA4(225 mm x 320 mm) is displayed as "225 mm x 319.9 mm" in Microsoft Office.
<li>8K(267 mm x 390 mm) is displayed as "266.9 mm x 389.9 mm" in Microsoft Office.
<li>16K(195 mm x 267 mm) is displayed as "194.9 mm x 266.9 mm" in Microsoft Office.
</ul>
</ul>
<h2><a name="">[Printing Issues]</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Additional Page Count in Duplex Printing
An extra page is added to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. The added page might be incremented in the printer's counter.
<li>Thin lines printed at high resolution (1200dpix1200dpi) might be difficult to see in the printed output. In such cases, use of a lower resolution is recommended.
<li>Some shaded images may not be printed correctly when Raster Mode is used.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Vector Mode in the PCL driver.
<li>Depending on the combination of text and font settings for watermark, text might not be printed.<br>
In such case, a change of font is recommended.
